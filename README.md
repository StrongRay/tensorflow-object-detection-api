# Tensorflow Object Detection API 

Learning about Tensorflow Object Detection API through "doing" instead of just "reading" someone else's code
I learnt that Jupyter notebook has a nice feature of saving as Python Codes.  However, as we all know, displaying images off Jupyter notebook is so different from off the command line.  Also, I have not seen a webcam piece of code working off a Juypter notebook =) Some other learnings included resolving "cannot display plt off matplotlib backend " and of course some quick codes to polish up Python programming.  

As Tensorflow 2.0 is coming up in 2019, there will be more improvements and "what's in research folder" in object-detection could be merged as a base. The surprising find is that the detection speed is quite impressive. 

Software:  UBUNTU 18.04, tensorflow 1.12, OpenCV 4.0.0-alpha, virtual environment, Python 3.6.7 [never ever go to 2.7]  
Hardware:  ASUS laptop, Intel® Core™ i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz × 4, GeForce 940MX/PCIe/SSE2, 12 GB memory, Microsoft 2MB USB Webcam

# Brief code walkthrough

To be added - but I have added comments within the code.  Should be easy to read.
